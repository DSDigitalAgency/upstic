# Project Summary

## Overview
Upstic is a healthcare recruitment platform that connects healthcare facilities with qualified healthcare professionals. The platform consists of three main portals:
- Admin Portal: For platform administrators to manage the entire system
- Client Portal: For healthcare facilities to post jobs and manage their recruitment
- Worker Portal: For healthcare professionals to find and apply for jobs

## Current State
The project is in active development with core functionality implemented and several features in progress. The main focus has been on building the admin portal's fundamental features and establishing the basic infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 13+ with App Router
- UI: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Hooks
- Authentication: Custom auth system
- API: REST API with Next.js API routes

## Key Features Implemented

## Current Focus Areas
1. Improving authentication security
2. Enhancing error handling
3. Implementing advanced search features
4. Optimizing performance
5. Adding comprehensive testing

## Known Issues
1. Authentication token refresh needs improvement
2. Some API endpoints need better error handling
3. Form validation needs standardization
4. Loading states need to be more consistent
